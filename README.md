# Mini-Alexa
A voice recognition system created using python that can perform certain activities when you give voice commands. Like Alexa, Siri.
I hope this will help you to create your own version of alexa. For this I used couple of python libraries here.

pyttsx3  - A text to speech converssion library in python. Here I used this to give voice commands. This will identify your voice and execute what you are saying. This is
supported for all voice-based services like Google, Bing. You can select your prefered version. You can get more idea from here.

pywhatkit -
A pyhton library which can use for various purposes. If you want to access google or youtube or things like that to get instructions, you can use this.
Example like "Hey Alexa, Play country roads " When you give command like that this library will help you to find that song and play for yoou. You can find it here.

pyjokes - A pyhton library which contains funny jokes. I added this one as a optional. It will give a random joke when you execute it. (https://pypi.org/project/pyjokes/)

You can add more funny conditions and try to impress your friends saying that now I know how to make an Alexa :).

This is just a funny project that I tried during my free time. ^_^
